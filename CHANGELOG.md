# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-27

- Four new reviewers, run when relevant and skipped with `--quick`:
  - `impact-analyzer`: blast radius of a change — dependents of changed exports, routes and schemas, breaking API changes, migration safety, new env vars, deploy order and rollback. Can block.
  - `ux-reviewer`: user flows, loading/error/empty states, accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), mobile layouts, copy and visual consistency. Can block only when a user can't complete a core task.
  - `test-reviewer`: risky changed behaviour without tests, tests that can't fail, weakened or skipped tests, flaky patterns. Warns, never blocks.
  - `design-reviewer`: architecture fit, duplication, coupling, data modelling and over-engineering. Warns, never blocks.
- `prepare` now reports triage signals (UI, schema/migration, API/entry points, deploy config, deleted files, code changed without tests).
- `--quick` runs only the core reviewers.
- finding-verifier has type-specific checks for the new reviewers; chat summaries tag each finding with its area.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-27

First release.

- `/ravenwatch:review`: multi-agent pre-push review (bug-hunter, security-auditor, loophole-hunter, resilience-reviewer, supply-chain-auditor, infra-config-auditor) with a finding-verifier pass and a BLOCK/WARN/PASS verdict.
- Deterministic pre-scan for secrets across every commit in the push range, sensitive files, large files and `.gitignore` gaps.
- Git `pre-push` hook (`/ravenwatch:install-git-hook`) as the authoritative gate: it checks the exact objects git is pushing, asks the remote which branches and tags it already has (verified against git's own view of the push target), and requires every new commit to be covered by a passing or owner-accepted review, with only the reviewed commit allowed as a new tip. Works in SHA-256 repositories.
- Claude guard hook that refuses Claude's pushes where the git hook isn't installed, refuses ways to skip or redirect it (`--no-verify`, hooks-path overrides, `GIT_CONFIG_*`, `-c`, aliases, includes, `send-pack`, receive-pack overrides), and refuses edits to `.git/hooks`, git config files and the verdict state.
- Reviewers get per-commit patches as well as the net diff, so changes made and later undone inside a push are reviewed too.
- Verdicts are tied to the reviewed range: `mark` refuses if HEAD moved since `prepare` or the run never finished, `--worktree` reviews never unlock a push, and `--since-last` only builds on a passing review. Recording a verdict always needs the owner's permission.
