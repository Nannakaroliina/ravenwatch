# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-27

First release.

- `/ravenwatch:review`: multi-agent pre-push review (bug-hunter, security-auditor, loophole-hunter, resilience-reviewer, supply-chain-auditor, infra-config-auditor) with a finding-verifier pass and a BLOCK/WARN/PASS verdict.
- Deterministic pre-scan for secrets across every commit in the push range, sensitive files, large files and `.gitignore` gaps.
- Git `pre-push` hook (`/ravenwatch:install-git-hook`) as the authoritative gate: it checks the exact objects git is pushing, asks the remote which branches and tags it already has (verified against git's own view of the push target), and requires every new commit to be covered by a passing or owner-accepted review, with only the reviewed commit allowed as a new tip. Works in SHA-256 repositories.
- Claude guard hook that refuses Claude's pushes where the git hook isn't installed, refuses ways to skip or redirect it (`--no-verify`, hooks-path overrides, `GIT_CONFIG_*`, `-c`, aliases, includes, `send-pack`, receive-pack overrides), and refuses edits to `.git/hooks`, git config files and the verdict state.
- Reviewers get per-commit patches as well as the net diff, so changes made and later undone inside a push are reviewed too.
- Verdicts are tied to the reviewed range: `mark` refuses if HEAD moved since `prepare` or the run never finished, `--worktree` reviews never unlock a push, and `--since-last` only builds on a passing review. Recording a verdict always needs the owner's permission.
